1.	Aggregation pipeline, projection, match, group, sort, populate,

2.	Lookup 

a.	Ans: $lookup stage lets you specify which collection you want to join with the current collection, and which fields that should match.

3.	basic search functionality

4.	pagination

5.	Embedded Document

An embedded, or nested, MongoDB Document is a normal document that's nested inside another document within a MongoDB collection. Embedded documents are particularly useful when a one-to-many relationship exists between documents.

6.	sorting

7.	indexing

a.	Ans: Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Indexes are special data structures [1] that store a small portion of the collection's data set in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field.

8.	populate method

9.	insert

10.	groupBy

11.	CAP

12.	PACELC

13.	Join two collections

14.	What is meant by non-relational database? 

Ans: Ability to store and process large amounts of unstructured data. As a result, it can process ANY type of data without needing to modify the architecture. So, creating and maintaining a NoSQL database is faster and cheaper

15.	Compare non-relational and relational database?

16. When to go for relational database? non-relational database?

Ans: In short, there is no single right answer. The best way to determine which database type is best for your project is to analyze the organization’s needs and application functionality you need to achieve.


SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications. Their models can ensure and enforce business rules at the data layer adding a level of data integrity that is not found in a non-relational database. They are excellent at keeping data transactions secure

NoSQL:
They provide flexible data model with the ability to easily store and combine data of any structure without the need to modify a schema. Became more popular for offering a more flexible, scalable and cost-efficient.

NoSQL tends to be a better option for modern applications that have more complex and constantly changing data sets, requiring a flexible data model that doesn’t need to be immediately defined.

 Most developers or organizations that prefer NoSQL databases, are attracted to the agile features that allow them to go to market faster, make updates faster

4) Why MongoDB is popular? 
Ans: MongoDB's document-oriented data model makes it exceptionally easy to add or change fields, among other things
